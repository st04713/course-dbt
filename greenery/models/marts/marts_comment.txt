data model layers wireframe for helping Jake

stg_events -> fct_events -> int_session_events_agg(containing summary statistics of events by user by session)
stg_users -> dim_users

int_session_events_agg + dim_users -> fct_user_sessions (summary stat of events + user relevant profile)

PO asks you "How long are people spending on our site ?"

# intro to marts: 
# Within each marts folder, create intermediate models and dimension/fact models.
# Core folder ~ core_dataset fact_orders, dim_products, dim_users
# Marketing folder ~ user_order_facts containing "order info by user level"
# Product folder ~ fact_page_views contains all page_view_events from greenery's event data 
# Q: thinking about product mart. What questions might we anticipate about our products?


# w2hw Part 1. Models, "no one is going to tell you which models to build"
# What are good indicators of a user who will likely purchase again? 
# What about indicators of users who are likely NOT to purchase again? 
# If you had more data, what features would you want to look into to answer this question?

#from product mart, we might we want to know how different products perform. 
# 1.What are daily page views by product? 
# 2.Daily orders by product? 
# 3.Whatâ€™s getting a lot of traffic, but maybe not converting into purchases?
