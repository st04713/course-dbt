data model layers wireframe for helping Jake

stg_events -> fct_events -> int_session_events_agg(containing summary statistics of events by user by session)
stg_users -> dim_users

int_session_events_agg + dim_users -> fct_user_sessions (summary stat of events + user relevant profile)

PO asks you "How long are people spending on our site ?"

# intro to marts: 
# Within each marts folder, create intermediate models and dimension/fact models.
# Core folder ~ core_dataset fact_orders, dim_products, dim_users
# Marketing folder ~ user_order_facts containing "order info by user level"
# Product folder ~ fact_page_views contains all page_view_events from greenery's event data 
# Q: thinking about product mart. What questions might we anticipate about our products?


# w2hw Part 1. Models, "no one is going to tell you which models to build"
# What are good indicators of a user who will likely purchase again? 
# What about indicators of users who are likely NOT to purchase again? 
# If you had more data, what features would you want to look into to answer this question?

#from product mart, we might we want to know how different products perform. 
# 1.What are daily page views by product? 
# 2.Daily orders by product? 
# 3.What’s getting a lot of traffic, but maybe not converting into purchases?

# fact_daily_performance_by_product.sql (metrics: #order, ##revenue, #page_view,  / freq: daily / slice&dice_level: product_id)

# _fact_daily_performance_by_product.yml ~ test your data model
# 1.What assumptions are you making about each model?, Did you find any “bad” data as you added and ran tests on your models? 
# 2.How did you go about either cleaning the data in the dbt model or adjusting your assumptions/tests?
# 3.Your stakeholders at Greenery want to understand the state of the data each day. Explain how you would ensure these tests are passing regularly and how you would alert stakeholders about bad data getting through.


#W3hw 
# part 1 : create new model to answer the first two questions ~ What is our overall conversion rate?, What is our conversion rate by product?
# Conversion rate is defined as the # of unique sessions with a purchase event / total number of unique sessions. 
# Conversion rate by product is defined as the # of unique sessions with a purchase event of that product / total number of unique sessions that viewed that product
# A question to think about: Why might certain products be converting at higher/lower rates than others? We don't actually have data to properly dig into this, but we can make some hypotheses.
