# we need source.yml (define our sources) and schema.yml (description of your data model, test it also)
# source.yml ~ configure source (schema, name), add source tables (table that dbt has not touched yet), configure freshness test
# schema.yml ~ add descriptions, configure tests
# models: staging folder, first interacted with raw ~ light transforamtions + renaming, recasting  # end result == easy to work with! ~ every sources should end up as a staging model either 1:1 with a source or a combination of base models
# model layers # organize project -> organize tables 

# fact_tables : what is the granularity in the table you want to work ?
# intermediate tables 

# dbt run -s +int_session_events_agg --run upstream
